# CE4348-Deadlock-Detection

The assigned task was to create a deadlock detection algorithm which would work with P amount of processes and R amount of resources. The problem size is given through the command line. Four other files are given as input to execute this algorithm, two vectors and two matrices. The vectors are: a used resources vector and an available resources vector. The matrices are: an allocation matrix and a process request matrix. The program needs to return whether a deadlock is present with the conditions presented or not.
